### **Background**

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.

Use the provided data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically,compare the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

### **Predict Model Performance**
Before creating and comparing the Logistical Regression and the Random Firest Classifer models, make a prediction as to which model will perform better. Determine each model's score using the score function and testing data. Provide the answer with justification in the designated area of the Jupyter Notebook.

### **Answer the following question**
Which model performed better? How does that compare to the prediction? Write down the results and any thoughts in the designated markdown cell.
